# A CNN Filter Pruning Method based on Weight Vector Similarity for Unstructured Pruning

This repository presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) filter pruning method based on weight vector similarity for unstructured pruning. The pruning method aims to reduce the computational complexity and memory footprint of CNN models while preserving their performance by identifying and removing redundant filters.

## Introduction

In deep learning models, CNNs often contain a large number of filters in each layer, resulting in high computational costs and memory requirements. Unstructured pruning methods aim to remove unnecessary filters to achieve model compression and acceleration. This repository introduces a novel filter pruning method based on weight vector similarity, which leverages the similarity between weight vectors to identify redundant filters.
